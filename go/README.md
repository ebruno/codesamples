# Examples in Golang #

 * fizzbuzz
 
      Process the numbers 1 - 100.\
      Writes fizz when the number is modulo 3\
      Writes buzz when the number is modulo 5\
      Writes fizzbuzz when the number is both modulo 3 and 5\
      Otherwise just writes the number.

 
 * numberadder
 
      The application is given two arbitrarily large numbers,\
      stored one digit at a time in a slice.\
      The first must be added to the second,\
      and the second must be reversed before addition.\
      The goal is to calculate the sum of those two sets of values.

 
 Both examples can be built with bazel or make.
